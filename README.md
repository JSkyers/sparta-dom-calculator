# Sparta Dom Calculator

For this task, I was requested to create a dynamic calculator using a combination of Javascript, HTML and CSS.

For this, I had to take advantage of the DOM which I used to directly change content on the HTML file from the Javascript file.

This proved to be my most difficult task to complete as I could tell there were multiple ways to tackle this task, some that could end in a dead end and some which could prove too long to complete in the time allocated.

I decided to used multiple event listeners and global variables to complete this task. I am aware of how repetitive the code is but for the sake of completing the task within the time allocated I decided to go for efficiency over quality.

I hope to come back and improve on this code in the future
